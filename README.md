Graceful degradation makes sure a website is functional even if all features aren't supported. Service workers are like background helpers for web app, providing offline support and faster loading times. They work together by allowing service workers to step in when needed, and a functional website when certain features arent available. For example, if you're offline, a service worker can show you cached content, to make sure you can still use the website. So, service workers enhance graceful degradation by maintaining functionality even if certain features aren't working as they shoud.
